# CS 6501: Software-Defined Networking and Programmable Networks

## Course description:
Today, we are witnessing a Cambrian explosion of applications with widely
different network requirements (e.g., video conferencing, AR/VR, remote
surgery). Yet network operators still rely on low-level commands when
configuring network devices and use archaic tools (e.g., ping, traceroute,
Wireshark) when troubleshooting connectivity or performance issues. As a
result, the Internet, or the network of networks, is showing its limits:
unplanned outages due to misconfigurations or cyberattacks are happening more
frequently with bigger and broader impacts.

Luckily, programmability is extending its reach to every corner of digital
communication these days. Open, programmable, and software-driven networks
allow us to develop innovative ways of managing networks, where
deeply-programmable network devices are now a commodity (e.g., programmable
switches, SmartNICs).  

In this class, we will learn about Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and
programmable networks. We will learn what kind of problems they have solved and
what new challenges they have introduced. Specific topics include (tentative
list): traditional networks and their problems, the history of SDN and
programmable networks, state-of-the-art programmable platforms (e.g., Intel
Tofino, SmartNICs), languages for programmable networks (e.g., OpenFlow, P4),
real-world applications and deployments, network verification, and AI/ML +
networking.

## Prerequisites
This course does not have official prerequisites. However, basic knowledge and
familiarity with computer networks will be helpful (e.g., TCP/IP layers, the
concept of packet headers, etc). CS/ECE 4457 is a good example for an
unofficial prerequisite.
